# Foam

Personal digital-garden and/or knowledge-map -- currently managed using [[foam]] for VSCode

## High level topics

In general I've always loved programming and problem solving. Recently while preparing for interviews I noticed that it felt like I was re-collecting and/or re-learning information that I had already gathered/known at some point This is what led me to the idea of starting a digital garden

Some of the high level topics I'm interested in (and will hopefully be filling with actual information) include:
- [[books]]
- [[dev-notes]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[foam]: foam "Foam"
[books]: books "Books"
[dev-notes]: dev-notes "Dev Notes"
