# Dev Setup

I've pretty much always used windows machines, though I've also spent a lot of time on said machines using putty to ssh into a linux box. That being said I have a few different but somewhat related development setups.

On windows alone I actually have 2 setups. At my current job, I'm unable to install WSL, so I set up my environment around powershell. That being said, on my personal computer I set up WSL and thus far I think I like it better than using powershell:

- [[wsl-setup]]
- [[powershell-setup]]

On linux/unix boxes I have another setup, though it overlaps significantly with my setup for wsl:

- [[unix-setup]]

All of my setups share some common components, including:

- [[vim]]
- [[vscode]]
