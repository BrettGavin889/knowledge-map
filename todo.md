# Todo

## Foam Todo

- [ ] add a keybinding for opening (or better toggling) foam graph
- [ ] add a keybinding for opening (or better toggling) backlinks
- [ ] default foam/vscode keybinding to follow definition is f12, default neovim binding is gd, not sure that I love either
- [ ] add a keyboard shortcut for **back** after following a link (defautl in vscode is alt-left arrow)
- [ ] not sure I love solarized colorscheme (don't like the yellow text for bullets or red-cursor)
  - atom one dark
  - night owl
  - gruvbox? -- I kind of like the idea of having a separate color scheme for this workspace though
- [ ] decide on/create a structure for notes, perhaps some high-level notes could be:
  - [ ] [[books]]
    - does this actually make sense to store here vs just keeping in goodreads? Feels somewhat redundant
  - [x] [[dev-notes]]
  - [x] [[text-editors]]
- [ ] if inbox and todo are going to be part of my workflow, perhaps add shortcut keybindings to open them
  - [ ] alt + i for inbox
  - [ ] alt + t for todo
