# Todo

## Foam Todo

- [ ] add a keybinding for opening (or better toggling) foam graph
- [ ] add a keybinding for opening (or better toggling) backlinks
- [ ] default foam/vscode keybinding to follow definition is f12, default neovim binding is gd, not sure that I love either
- [ ] add a keyboard shortcut for **back** after following a link (defautl in vscode is alt-left arrow)
- [ ] not sure I love solarized colorscheme (don't like the yellow text for bullets or red-cursor)
  - atom one dark
  - night owl
  - gruvbox? -- I kind of like the idea of having a separate color scheme for this workspace though
- [ ] decide on/create a structure for notes, perhaps some high-level notes could be:
  - [ ] [[books]]
    - does this actually make sense to store here vs just keeping in goodreads? Feels somewhat redundant
  - [x] [[dev-notes]]
  - [x] [[text-editors]]
- [ ] if inbox and todo are going to be part of my workflow, perhaps add shortcut keybindings to open them
  - [ ] alt + i for inbox
  - [ ] alt + t for todo
- [ ] look into whether or not foam supports note tags
  - After a quick look I didn't find anything relating to tags in the foam repo, though one of the included extensions vscode-markdown-notes seems to support tags
  - Testing adding a tag #todo
    - the general concept of tags seems to be supported, though the keybindings are not great at best
    - shift-f12 peek references, shift-alt-f12 go to all references (pull list up in side panel)
    - arrow keys move around reference list (hjkl vim-like bindings don't work)
    - enter on a particular reference opens the containing note but doesn't move editor focus -- I'm actually not sure how to move the focus from the references side panel back to (any) note
- [ ] look into software to manage references/bibliography -- [jabref](https://www.jabref.org/)
