## Reading Habits: Putting It All Together

- learning is about coverage, practice and insight -- writing about what you read helps to reveal the gaps in your understanding
- coverage is mostly about reading techniques -- more specifically how to most efficiently takes notes
- reading can be split into 2 stages
  - collecting - want to be fast and generate a lot of intermediate products to work with later
    - highlighting and/or writing notes in the margin means you'll always need to physical copy -- instead write down interesting parts immediately, on a separate piece of paper, in your own words
  - processing - combine notes into clusters before adding to zettelkasten -- helps you think about text as a whole
- the more you know about a subject, the longer it takes to integrate material into your zettelkasten -- integrating material will eventually become your bottleneck
