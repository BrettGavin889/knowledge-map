I'm still pretty new to the idea of knowledge maps/second brains/zettelkasten so I'm not entirely sure what the best way to structure all of this is, so for now I'm going to add a few notes/thoughts here and intend on moving them elsewhere when I know where they should go:

While reading a blog post on Zettlekasten the other day, the idea of the Collector's Fallacy seemed to resonate with me. The main point of the blog was to explain that collecting sources of information (without processing them) not only isn't helpful, but can actually be detrimental if your collection becomes so large that it is intimidating. This idea/concept resonated with me because I have definitely fallen into a pattern of collecting various sources of information as bookmarks and the most frequent result is for me to never look at the bookmark again. One of the main points the blog post made was that information needs to be processed (typically in the form of taking notes in your own words) before it actually becomes part of your knowledge. The flip side of this is that letting your inbox/collection of sources become too large often leads to never actually extracting the knowledge from the sources. To handle this issue, one must find a way to limit the size of their information inbox (essentially either by being more selective about what makes it into the inbox, or by processing the sources in your inbox more frequently, or both)

What's interesting is that I read the above mentioned blog post no more than 3-4 days ago, and yet I realized that I already forgot a decent amount of it as I was just trying to type up a summary of it. This does seem to drive home the idea that until you actually process information and/or actively use it somehow it won't be a part of your knowledge. The take away from this idea is one that I hadn't ever actually considered, despite knowing about the idea itself to some extent. The take away is that reading without taking notes is essentially a waste of time (because you will eventually forget what you read, which leads to 1 of 2 options, either you never use the information again, in which case why did you spend time reading to begin with, or alternatively if you do need the information in the future, you'll have to re-read at least part of the original source, essentially making the first reading a waste of time). I forget if the article pointed this out or not, but it seems clear to me that this idea only really applies to knowledge-based reading (i.e. it wouldn't apply to reading a fictional book which you are reading purely because you like to read)

To start more from the beginning, the above mentioned blog post is part of a larger blog series on the topic of Zettlekasten, the following are notes from the [Introductory Blog](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/):

- In general Zettlekasten is a method for how to deal with knowledge throughout your life
  - Like any skill, it takes practice to get used to and/or better at
  - It is a tool for thinking and writing -- hypertext features make creating a web of thoughts possible (which is the main distinction from other knowledge systems)
- zettlekasten is a significant improvement over standard note taking approaches -- it amplifies effectiveness
  - improves connectivity of thoughts -- connections between ideas make finding new insights possible
  - even if you don't use notes you've taken in the immediate future, you would have still prepared the knowledge for future projects
  - helps you to be able to tackle more complex problems -- allows you to focus on a small part of a problem and after take a step back and look at the panorama view
  - Scales much better than normal note taking over time
  - people tend to have a limited capacity for following a single line of thought for a long period of time -- zettelkasten will help you keep you thoughts alive and help you hold on to them

The 3 most important properties of a zettelkasten:
- It's hyper-textual - texts that refer to each other and explain or expand on the information in others
  - The emphasis put on forming relationships makes it such that connecting (instead of collecting) is the priority
- It adheres to the Principle of Atomicity  -- each zettel only contains one unit of knowledge (most often each zettel is a single thought)
- It is personal -- there is 1 zettelkasten per person, and one person per zettelkasten

Each zettel should have 3 components:
1. a unique ID
2. the body of the zettel -- this contains whatever you want to capture, the knowledge
   - most important aspect of the body is that it's written in your own words -- your zettelkasten will truely be yours if it contains your own content (and not just a collection of other peoples thoughts)
   - limiting the scope of each zettel to a single thought allows your zettelkasten to help you think (instead of just assisting in creating excerpts for example)
   - want to capture knowledge instead of just information -- should always make something from the information you process, i.e. should always translate information to knowledge by adding context and relevance
   - when debating whether or not to take/create a note, when in doubt write the note, in the confines of your deadline -- any knowledge added could potentially be useful at some future time (perhaps unrelated to why you took the note)
     - Need to compromise between broad note taking and focusing on current projects/tasks/work -- i.e. you can't take random notes on anything you're interested in and expect to get anything done
     - The amount of deviation you should allow depends on what you deadline is
     - The decision to work focused on projects vs allowing deviation isn't necessarily directly related to zettelkasten -- it's more related to the circumstances of your life
3. references -- at the bottom you either reference the source of the knowledge (or leave it blank if you capture you own thoughts)
    - recommended software on windows to manage bibliographies is [jabref](https://www.jabref.org/)

Connecting Zettel
- when you relate pieces of knowledge, you create relationships -- knowledge relationships improve recall and also help your mind see patterns
- When making connections, always state the context (i.e. state explicitly why you made the link)
  - without link context your future self won't know why he should follow a link

Structure Notes
- Adding some sort of hierarchical structure to your zettelkasten can be very useful
  - increases potential for knowledge creation and helps you to see the bigger picture
- A structure note is a zettel about other zettels -- serve as fast tracks to navigate through the web of notes
- A single zettel can be linked to from multiple structure notes

Notes About Individual Zettel Layout
- the ID of the zettel is both in the filename and in the contents of the file
- using a time-based ID can be helpful as it never changes -- this allows you to change the title of notes without breaking any links
- tags can be denoted using hashtags -- clicking on a hashtag should perform a search for the tag

## Learn Faster with Zettel Notes
- Drilldown Method consists of 3 stages:
    1. coverage - use efficient reading techniques to drill through texts quickly -- the general idea is to skim the material before diving in, the following steps could be used:
       1. Look over the headlines (to get a feeling for the structure)
       2. Decide what you want to know after reading the text
       3. Quickly look at the paragraphs to get a sense of what is in each section
       4. Mark/take note of paragraphs/sections you find useful -- don't take elaborate notes, just flag them for actually reading
    2. practice - takes notes and test whether you understand what the text contains
       1. after getting the overview of a topic, you have to understand it to be able to actually learn it -- deepening your understanding of a topic is largely based on the following 2 things:
          1. Making connections
          2. Debugging errors -- this can also be thought of as getting the information out of the text, process is:
             1. re-read passages marked as interesting (only read passages if you're positive that they contain knowledge you want to keep)
             2. take notes -- search for statements which caught your attention or got you thinking -- compacting key statements will challenge you intellectually every time (this challenge is how you create lasting knowledge)
    3. insight - integrate the notes into your note archive to create lasting knowledge
       1. Making connections between notes allows the knowledge to be accessible after your brain forgets the specific contents of a note
       2. Notes should be based on concepts (instead of strictly following the structure of a text)
       3. You may find similar concepts in different texts -- you can either merge the concepts into a single note, or write about the relationship between the texts in a separate note
       4. It's important to see connections between your notes, and it's important that the connections make sense to you (though it doesn't matter if they make sense to someone else)

## The difference between good and bad tags

There are 2 types of tags:
1. Tags for topics -- group notes under a topic
2. Tags for objects -- used to group notes around an object (real or conceptual)

When you are working on a particular topic, you are typically working across a number of concepts (here concepts are better used as tags than topics)

Broad, general connections (which is often the case when tagging/connecting based on topics) tend not to be useful in the long run -- tags for objects are much more precise and help reveal real connections
