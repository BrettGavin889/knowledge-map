# Vscode Neovim

## Pros

- Significantly less laggy than VIM-VSCode
- Supports most vim plugins natively
  - Makes vim config updates to support VSCode manageable, meaning I can still use vim for tasks that don't necessarily require an IDE

## Cons

- Various bugs and/or inherant problems
  - inserted text occasionally getting entered twice
